          <h1>About the Project</h1>
              <p>
              This project was created as the final for <strong>DS4200: Information Presentation and Visualization</strong> at Northeastern University.
              Our goal was to explore and communicate insights about Bluebike usage patterns in and around the Northeastern campus using interactive,
              data-driven visualizations.
          </p>
              <p>
                  We analyzed real trip data to understand how ride volume, user behavior, and station activity fluctuate across time, space, and rider type.
                  Each of our five visualizations was carefully designed to highlight a unique dimension of the story, from seasonal trends to daily commuter
                  rhythms, while giving viewers the ability to interact with and explore the data on their own terms.
              </p>
              <p>
                  This project showcases the skills we’ve developed throughout the semester in data wrangling, visual design, interactivity, and narrative
                  presentation—all with the aim of turning complex information into clear, engaging insights.
